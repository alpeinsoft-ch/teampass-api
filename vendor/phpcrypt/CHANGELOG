2014-05-09  phpCrypt-0.5.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* Fixed error message in Rijndael.php which inaccurately
	reported an incorrect key size in bits instead of bytes

	* Fixed a typo in the blockSize() call in the Rijdael.php
	contructor

2013-09-18  phpCrypt-0.5  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added CAST-128 cipher

	* Added CAST-256 cipher

	* Added support for 8 and 16 byte keys in addition
	to 24 byte keys for Triple DES (3DES)

	* Removed the OneTimePad cipher. This was redundant since
	the SimpleXOR cipher is the same as a one time pad when
	the key length is the same as the length of data length,
	and the key is unique for each block of data.

	* Added PHP_Crypt::createKey(), a helper function to generate
	a random string of bytes that can be used as a key for a
	cipher. See the examples directory to see how it is used.

	* Added PHP_Crypt::setKey() so that it is possible to set
	the key to a new value without having to create an new
	instance of phpCrypt

	* Renamed PHP_Crypt::cipherSetKey() to PHP_Crypt::cipherKey()

	* Updated the constants used for PHP_Crypt::createKey() and
	PHP_Crypt::createIV(). Both now use the PHP_Crypt::RAND
	constants. The PHP_Crypt::IV constants have been removed.

	* Changed SimpleXOR from a block cipher to a stream cipher
	since this is what it really is.

	* In Cipher.php made the $key member private, renamed
	setKey() to key(), and key() is now used to retrieve the
	current key in use by all extending classes

	* Minor changes to how RC2::splitBytes() works using
	array_map()

	* Fixed an error message that occurs in php 5.3 in RC2.php

	* Renamed Base.php to Core.php

	* Replaced for() loops with array_map() in Core.php where
	possible for minor speed improvements

	* Shortened the name of functions in Core.php, and updated
	all files that use those functions.

	* Create a workaround in Core::rotateBitsLeft32() and
	Core::rotateBitsRight32() which caused them to not always
	work correctly on 32 bit platforms

	* Fixed Core::uInt() and Core::uInt32() which caused them to
	not always work correctly on 32 bit platforms

	* Major bug fix in how CTR mode works. Previously it was not
	fully compatible with mCrypt's CTR mode.

2013-07-21  phpCrypt-0.4  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added the 3-Way cipher. phpCrypt's implementation is
	compatible with mCrypts implementation, though there may
	be a bug in mCrypt's 3-Way gamma() function. phpCrypt
	mimics the bug to make it compatible, if it is a bug.
	Unfortunately I do no know enough about 3-Way nor could
	I find much information on it to know if the gamma() function
	is suppose to behave the way it does. Please read phpCrypt's
	3Way::gamma() function comment for further information.

	* Windows users now have the option to create an IV using
	the secure random number generator found in the Microsoft
	CAPICOM SDK. The new constant is PHP_Crypt::IV_WIN_COM.
	View the README file for more information.

	* Fixed a bug in CTR mode where the last few bytes may
	not get passed to the cipher in some cases

	* Mode::CreateIV() now hashes the random string of bytes
	before returning it as the IV. This helps in the adding
	additional 'randomness' to the IV

	* Bug fixes and minor speed improvements in some of the
	modes.

	* Updated all functions and calculations to handle block
	size in bytes instead of bits. This makes the API less
	confusing and fewer conversions from bits to bytes.

2013-07-19  phpCrypt-0.3.2  Ryan Gilfether

	* Version 0.3.1 contained some incomplete files and bugs
	which were not fixed before the release. This version
	addresses those issues.

	* Fixes in the examples code

	* Removed the PHP_Crypt::setIV() function and renamed to
	PHP_Crypt::IV()

2013-07-18  phpCrypt-0.3.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* Found a major bug in the way IV's are used in Encryption
	and Decryption. The $iv parameter has been removed from
	PHP_Crypt::Encrypt() and PHP_Crypt::Decrypt() function, and
	instead the IV should be set with PHP_Crypt::setIV()

	* Updated the code in the 'examples' directory to reflect
	the changes made to correct the IV bug

	* Updated README and README.md to reflect the changes made
	for the IV bug

2013-07-12  phpCrypt-0.3  Ryan Gilfether

	* Added the Blowfish Cipher

	* Updated CryptBase::decimal2Hex() with a parameter to force
	the returned hex to specified byte size

	* Updated RC2.php to use the uInt() function

	* Added PHP_Crypt::SetIV() function

	* Removed the $iv parameter from PHP_Crypt::CreateIV(),
	now to set the IV use the PHP_Crypt::SetIV() function,
	or pass the IV in the encrypt() or decrypt() function

	* Renamed CryptBase.php to Base.php. Removed it as a parent
	class to all other classes except the Cipher class, as it
	was the only class that really needed it.

	* General performance improvements

2013-06-28  phpCrypt-0.2  Ryan Gilfether

	* Fixed Enigma so that it works on both 64 and 32 bit platforms

	* Renamed & fixed the following functions in CryptBase.php
	to use native PHP function calls:
	uInt(), sInt(), uInt32(), sInt32(), uChar(), sChar()

2013-06-24  phpCrypt-0.1  Ryan Gilfether

	* The initial release of phpCrypt 0.1
